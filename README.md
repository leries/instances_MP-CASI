# instances_MP-CASI
In this repository, we provide the instances used in our paper "Optimizing assortment and inventory on shelves when products perish".

The **instances for each product/shelf life category** (ultra-fresh, fresh, semi-fresh) that are used in Sections 5.2(a), 5.3, 5.4(b), and 5.5 contain the parameters for the base case (see Section 5.1) and are in xlsx format. Each instance contains 30 products; the corresponding parameter is indicated in the column head.

The **benchmark instances** (csv) have the following structure:
+ Each row contains data for one product, and one instance consists of 50 products, i.e., each csv file has 50 rows
+ Column 1: Expected demand
+ Column 2: Standard deviation of demand
+ Column 3: Space-elasticity
+ Column 4: Sales price
+ Column 5: Unit cost
+ Column 6: Salvage value
+ Column 7: Stockout cost
+ Column 9: Product width
+ Column 11: Min. number of facings
+ Column 12: Max. number of facings
+ Column 14: Stock per facing
